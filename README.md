# EZHomesteading

EZ Homesteading is a multivendor marketplace application with an emphasis on connecting family-scale farmers and gardeners with local consumers in their area. There are currently two roles on the site. A Co-Op, which can also be thought of as a vendor, is assigned a store upon signing up. They then can customize their store's appearance and functionality with a profile picture, a store banner, hours of operation, and much more. Additionally, Co-Ops can list items for sale so long as they are homesteading, farmer's market, or self-sufficiency-related. This can be anything from homegrown tomatoes to homemade candles to water purification tablets. The other role on the site currently is a consumer, which as the name implies, are people who are interested in anything homesteading, farmer's market, or self-sufficiency-related. Consumers can search for items or browse through an assortment of categories.
